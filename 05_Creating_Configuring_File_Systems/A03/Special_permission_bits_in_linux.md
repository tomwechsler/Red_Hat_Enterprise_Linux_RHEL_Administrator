üõ†Ô∏è Notes

The numeric value is used as the first digit in the chmod permission mode.

These special bits can be combined:

chmod 6755 file ‚Üí sets SUID (4) + SGID (2) = 6

chmod 7755 dir ‚Üí sets SGID (2) + Sticky Bit (1) = 3

Final permission format:
[special][owner][group][others] ‚Üí e.g. chmod 4755
means SUID + standard rwxr-xr-x (755) permissions.

Special bits are useful for system-level scripts, shared directories, and security-related behavior.
